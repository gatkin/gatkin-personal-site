I am a software developer currently living in Lincoln, Nebraska. I love creating and building with software. I have worked in a variety of technologies ranging from C running on embedded devices and mobile phones to Python to distributed .NET microservices.

When I am away from the keyboard, I love to run, hike, and climb.
