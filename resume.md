## Experience

### Software Engineer

**Spreetail** <br/>
January 2019 to Present <br />
Lincoln, NE

I am a member of the marketplace channels squad building and operating a business-critical, distributed .NET microservices system that is responsible for all communications with external marketplaces and handles the majority of the company's revenue.

- I helped launch a new marketplace integration with Home Depot that brought in $1 million of revenue in the first month.

- I designed and built solutions for monitoring and visualizing the operation of my team's system, which consists of over a dozen microservices. These solutions have been critical for detecting outages and keeping our business-critical services up and running. To assist with this effort, I [developed and open-sourced](https://gatkin.github.io/nrdashboards/), as a personal side project, a tool for better managing my team's New Relic dashboards.

### Software Engineer

**Garmin** <br/>
January 2016 to December 2018 (3 years) <br/>
Olathe, KS

I was a member of the Marine division where I worked primarily in embedded C to deliver features across a range of platforms from embedded Marine devices to Android and iOS mobile applications.

- I was the lead developer responsible for designing, building, and delivering the over-the-air software updates feature that allows users to easily download and install software updates for their on-vessel marine devices from their mobile phone. I built C modules that ran across Android, iOS, and embedded Marine devices to implement this feature

- I implemented a delivery pipeline to reliably assemble and publish update packages for Marine devices. This automated much of what had previously been a manual, laborious, and error-prone process.

- I focused strongly on test automation from unit testing embedded C, to building automated testing infrastructure for testing the wide range of integrated, networked devices in the Marine ecosystem. I led workshops and gave presentations on unit testing practices in C to the other developers on my team.

### Software Engineer Intern

**Garmin** <br/>
Summer 2015 <br/>
Olathe, KS


I was a member of the positioning and sensors team where I developed a new algorithm to compute road gradient on cycling devices that combined multiple sensor inputs in order to achieve greater accuracy and lower latency over the existing gradient algorithm. I prototyped algorithms in MATLAB--processing and analyzing sensor data--before implementing them in C to run and test on the devices. I also made bug fixes to various features in my teamâ€™s module. 

<br />

### Software Engineer Intern

**Cerner** <br/>
Summer 2014 <br/>
Kansas City, MO

I developed a custom Maven plugin to automatically upload, configure, and deploy Java projects onto staging servers as part of the build process. I also developed a Ruby dashboard that collected data from a variety of sources, including third party APIs and internal databases, to display important information for our development team.

<br />

### Undergraduate Research Assistant

**University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Department of Computer Science and Engineering** <br/>
May 2013 - May 2015 <br/>
Lincoln, NE

I researched applying machine learning to improve survey data quality for Census and Gallup surveys. This work was presented at the 2014 and 2015 American Association for Public Opinion Research conferences.
