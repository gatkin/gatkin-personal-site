- Worked primarily C, along with some C++, to deliver features across a range of platforms from embedded Marine devices to Android and iOS mobile applications.
- Built internal Python tools to automate development tasks.
- Lead developer responsible for designing, building, and delivering the over-the-air software updates feature that allows users to easily download and install software updates for their on-vessel Marine devices using their mobile phone.
- Implemented a delivery pipeline to reliably assemble and publish update packages for Marine devices. This automated much of what had previously been a manual, laborious, and error-prone process.
